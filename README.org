* Abstract
This is my configuration for creating a website using Emac's org-mode and Jekyll.

* Developer Requirements
Reproducing this is pretty easy - just follow the below links and it shouldn't take too long to set up a working example. 

- Emacs (see https://github.com/markrepedersen/emacs-configuration for information on installation and configuration).
- Org-mode (see https://github.com/markrepedersen/emacs-configuration/blob/master/lisp/org-init.el for how to configure it).
- Jekyll (see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ for installation).
