This page is for setting up my emacs configuration.

* Installation
** Clone
Clone this repository to your $HOME folder.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/markrepedersen/emacs-configuration.git ~/.emacs.d/~
#+end_src

** Install Emacs
Obviously, Emacs must be installed using your package manager of choice.

*** MacOS
Emacs comes with MacOS out of the box, however, its version is quite old. I'd recommend either upgrading the built-in one or using Homebrew to install a new one.

Here's what I use: 

#+begin_src bash
brew install emacs-head --HEAD --with-cocoa --with-mailutils --with-jansson --with-crash-debug --with-retro-icon-gnu-head
ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-head/Emacs.app /Applications
alias emacs="/usr/local/Cellar/emacs-head/HEAD-e6c6486_1/bin/emacs -nw"
#+end_src

*** Ubuntu
#+begin_src bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
#+end_src

* Docker 
To ensure reliable builds, it's nice to compile/run code on a standardized machine. Docker is good for this.

- [ ] Publish image to Docker Hub.

To build the image: 

#+begin_src bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t emacs:latest .
#+end_src

To run the image:
#+begin_src bash
docker run -it emacs:latest bash
#+end_src

* Dependencies
The following dependencies will have to be installed on your system. 
On MacOS, Emacs doesn't share your session's PATH variable. See `lisp/exec-path-from-shell-init.el` for how this is handled.

** The Silver Searcher (ag)
Follow the installation instructions here: 
[[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher]]

** Fish shell
Follow the installation instructions here: 
https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell

** LSP
This makes Emacs into a full-blown IDE. The following language servers must be installed for C/C++/Rust/Python to work. 
All other languages will have their respective servers automatically installed.
*** ccls 
**** MacOS
#+begin_src bash
brew install ccls
#+end_src

**** Linux

*** lsp-python-ms
